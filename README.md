In this project, I developed a series of Python scripts to scrape film data from Letterboxd. Libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup were used for web automation and HTML parsing. Some of the scripts only look for Narrative Feature Films, so the TMDB API is queried, in order to reject disallowed genres. Additionally, CSV Whitelists and Blacklists are also referenced. The final film lists are outputted into CSV or JSON format. Other qualifications, such as minimum watch count, or specific genre can also be added. Each script is designed to be modular, enabling users to run specific scrapers based on their needs, whether for popular films, highest-rated films, or genre-specific lists.
